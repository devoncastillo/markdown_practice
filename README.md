| DATE. | NAME OF PARTY ARRESTED. | RESIDENCE. | WHERE CONFINED. | NAME OF COMPLAINANT. | NATURE OF COMPLAINT. | REMARKS. |

Note on Table Syntax: I know the syntax I've used does not appear to match the transcription tips, however, this markdown syntax more closely matches the actual table in the image. The double asterisks on the numbers display them in bold to match the headers, since there currently is no markdown syntax for subheaders. Using | :-: | instead of | --- | displays the numbers as center-aligned in the columns, just like they are in the original image.
